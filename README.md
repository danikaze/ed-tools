# ed-tools

**_Elite Dangerous Tools_** is just a small app to detect and extract changes from your running session of the game by listening to changes in the game journal.

## Installation

Since this is just an early development version, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is required to run this tool, but [providing an executable is planned](https://github.com/danikaze/ed-tools/issues/12) (as well as [a UI](https://github.com/danikaze/ed-tools/issues/11)).

For now, source code needs to be built after being downloaded

```
npm run build
```

And then it can be run like this anytime:

```
npm run start
```

## Architecture

All the processing is split in several phases.

There's a singleton [EventManager](src/ed/event-manager.ts) and a singleton [DataManager](src/ed/data-manager.ts).

- The `EventManager` is listening to the Elite Dangerous Journal file and triggers [events](src/ed/interfaces.ts) when they happen.
- The `DataManager` listens to those events through the [EventProcessors](src/event-processors) and update the _data library_, which is accessible from other parts of the code as well. When any data is updated, an event is triggered so actions can be taken.
- The next step is done by the [InfoGenerators](src/info-generators), which create texts that can be used some way (usually piped to a [file writer](src/outputters/write-file.ts) instance)
- The last step is done by the [Outputters](src/outputters), which accept strings (provided by the `InfoGenerators`) and do something with them, so they are usable by external programs (such as [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)).

### Notes

`DataManager` listen to game Events (triggered by `EventManager`), and since those Events could affect more than one data at the same time, the events triggered by the `DataManager` are done after all the updates are finished, providing as well the timestamp, so the `InfoGenerators` don't run several times for the same update.

Some `Outputters` could act as a _middle-ware_ for `Outputters` as well. (i.e. the [Rotator](src/outputters/rotator.ts) accepts several `InfoGenerators` and manages the info outputting it into only one file via another piped `Outputter`)

There are [middlewares](src/info-generators/middleware) for the `InfoGenerators` as well. They take the incoming data and can cancel the generation (by returning `undefined` or returning a modified version of the data itself)

## Is it safe?

Completely!
It reads information provided by [Frontier](https://frontier.co.uk/) in the game intended to develop third party applications like [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector).

It only provides game of the game universe, nothing personal.
If you are curiours, you can check the content of the `Journal` files in the directory: `C:\Users\%userprofile%\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous`

## Configuration

Yes, some settings are required to make this app work! But from version 0.5.0 this is possible to be configured using [settings.json](static/settings.json) (or `settings.js` with `module.exports` would work too).

This is the list of all settings available so far (settings without a default are required)

### Root level

| Setting           | Description                                                                                                                                                  |

| eventsFilePath    | Path to the file where the events information will be written. If specified, the folder must exist but can left blank to not outputting this information     |
| eventsFileOptions | Options related to the events information ([WriteFileOutputter options](#writefileoutputter-options))                                                        |

### EventManager options

| Setting       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| journalFolder | Folder where `.journal` files are. Default: `C:\Users\%userprofile%\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous`                                                                                                                                     |

| logEvents     | Array of `'used'` or `'unused'`. Shows when one event is detected. Default: `[]`                                                                                                                                                                           |
